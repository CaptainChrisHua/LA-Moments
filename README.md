- **React** handles UI rendering; **React-Router-DOM** manages routing.

- **Material UI (MUI)** and **Google APIs** enhance the front-end experience.
- **Redux** manages global state with **Reducers**, **Actions**, and **Store**.
- **Axios** in API layer performs HTTP requests to the backend.
- **Express.js** defines backend routes via **express.Router()**.
- **jsonwebtoken** in middleware secures routes with authentication.
- **Controllers** handle business logic and interact with **Mongoose** models.
- **MongoDB** stores app data, connected via **Mongoose**.

## Getting Started (with Docker üê≥)

### Prerequisites

To run `SkyLens`, you'll need:

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/)
- [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/atlas/database) or a local MongoDB instance
- [Google API Client ID](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis) for Google OAuth login

### Setup Instructions

1. Copy the example `.env` files in the `client/` and `server/` folders to create your actual environment configuration files:

```bash
cp client/.env.example client/.env
cp server/.env.example server/.env
```

2. Open the newly created `.env` files and **replace the placeholder values** with your own configuration.

#### Example: `client/.env`
```env
REACT_APP_API_URL=http://localhost:8080/api
REACT_APP_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your-google-client-id
```

#### Example: `server/.env`

```
PORT=8080
MONGODB_URI=mongodb://your-mongodb-uri
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your-google-client-id
JWT_SECRET=your-secret
```



3. In the root directory, build and start all services:

```bash
docker-compose up -d --build
```



4. Access the app: http://localhost



## Alternative Manual Setup (Node + React)

If you prefer to run without Docker:

1. Install dependencies for the backend:

```bash
cd server
npm install
npm start
```

2. In a second terminal, install and run the frontend:

```bash
cd client
npm install --legacy-peer-deps
npm start
```

3. The frontend will run at `http://localhost:3000`
